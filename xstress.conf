# Some notes about editing this file
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Don't play with spaces, the parser is not designed to handled extra spaces 
# before or after the text.
# Comments start with the hash (#) sign on the first column ONLY
# Most of the configuration file is self explanatory, comments are provided wherever
# necessary. You may read the accompanying README file for more details.

# HELO/EHLO String which should be used. Normally you would use the FQDN
# of the host where xstress runs (e.g. myhostname.mydomain.tld). If HELO
# is unset, `localhost` will be used (which isn't a FQDN but at least
# a valid value).
HELO=localhost

# A Value of ZERO for MAILS_PER_THREAD means unlimited mails per thread
